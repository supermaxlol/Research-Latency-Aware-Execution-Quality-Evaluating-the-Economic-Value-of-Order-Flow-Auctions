## **🚨 BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY**

> **We have documented the first systematic evidence of directional asymmetries in Order Flow Auction (OFA) execution quality, revealing a fundamental market structure failure that challenges core assumptions about competitive auction mechanisms in decentralized finance.**

### **🎯 Key Finding**
- **58.4 basis point directional gap** between ETH sales (+23.5% markouts) and ETH purchases (-34.9% markouts)
- **Systematic across platforms**: CoWSwap (64.7 bps), 1inch Fusion (47.7 bps)  
- **Persistent over time**: Strengthens from 1s (58.5 bps) to 60s (59.3 bps)
- **Intensifies with volatility**: Expands to 99.4 bps during high volatility periods

## **📊 Research Summary**

### **Dataset Overview**
![Dataset Overview](figure1_dataset_overview.svg)

*Our comprehensive analysis covers 21,673 transactions from May 5-12, 2025, evenly distributed across CoWSwap (49.7%) and 1inch Fusion (50.3%), with 6,942 ETH-stablecoin pairs forming the core of our directional asymmetry analysis.*

### **Methodology Innovation**
- ✨ **First application** of forward-looking markout analysis to DeFi OFA contexts
- 🎯 **Novel benchmark**: Using Binance midprice for execution quality measurement  
- ⏱️ **Multi-horizon analysis**: 1s, 10s, 60s post-execution tracking
- 📈 **Comprehensive coverage**: 21,673 transactions across major platforms

### **Cross-Platform Validation**
![Platform Comparison](figure2_platform_comparison.svg)

*Despite implementing different auction mechanisms (CoWSwap: batch auctions, 1inch Fusion: Dutch auctions), both platforms exhibit substantial directional asymmetries, demonstrating that our findings reflect fundamental market structure rather than platform-specific artifacts.*

### **Statistical Validation**
- **t-statistics**: >17 for both directions (p < 10^-60)
- **Win rates**: 77.6% (ETH sales) vs. 26.8% (ETH purchases)  
- **Daily consistency**: 100% of analyzed days show significant asymmetries
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent across different auction mechanisms

### **Token Pair Analysis**
![Token Pair Analysis](figure4_token_pair_analysis.svg)

*Directional asymmetries are specific to ETH-stablecoin pairs. WETH-USDC achieves +0.235% markouts with 78.6% win rates, while USDC-WETH suffers -0.312% markouts with only 26.6% win rates. Critically, stablecoin-to-stablecoin pairs show balanced performance, serving as important control evidence.*

### **Mechanism Identification**
```
CEX-DEX Latency Arbitrage
├── Price discovery on centralized exchanges first
├── 12-second block time windows for solver observation  
├── Selective order filling based on CEX price movements
└── Systematic adverse selection against retail traders
```
